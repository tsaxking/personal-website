I started writing Concerto for Alto Saxophone in April 2019 and finished it the following December.<br><br>My performance of this piece won a spot in the 2020 Boise State University Concerto Aria Competition, but due to COVID-19, the concert was unfortunately cancelled so I wasn’t able to premier the orchestral version. A little humble-brag: I was the first competitor ever to compose the piece they performed.<br><br>To finish my 2020 recital at Boise State University on February 20th, I premiered the 2 piano version with Del Parkinson and Peggy Purdy, two accompanists who have always supported me. I wish to use this piece to say thank you to all my instructors who have taught me and convey a special gratitude to Rodney Zuroeveste and Sandon Mayhew.",

When performed, each moment only happens once and never again, but each one contributes to another. To me, this is analogous to who we, as people, are. Every single person has millions and millions of moments that they are made of which came and went in the blink of an eye. We have a way of looking back on these moments with photographs and memories, but those moments will never happen again. Each person contributes to the people’s moments around them, so let’s make the best of them. Be the best who you can be.",

            "description": "I started this piece in 2017 and it took me 5 years to complete it. It's in three movements and a coda:<br><br>The first is about my struggle with social anxiety. I often feel as if I have no voice and have a hard time keeping my head above the water. Throughout the beginning movement, there is at least one person not playing to represent this struggle.<br><br>The second is about the two quartets conversing with each other. When this gets performed, I want to see some sort of visual representation of this, quartet one steps forward, or some sort of body language to really help demonstrate this.<br><br>The last movement is about pairs of instruments talking to each other. At every moment throughout this movement, two parts are working together, sometimes the whole ensemble is playing but it is clear which parts coincide with each other.<br><br>The last section is similar to movement 2 but I didn't really want to describe it as a whole movement because it's the finale. This will be memorized and each member steps in front of their stands. All soprano and alto saxophones are in different time signatures but playing at the same time so their parts won't line up but combine to make a brilliant sound. As that's happening, the tenor and baritone saxophones start playing their block chords to fill the room. After a few repetitions, every part starts breaking off leaving just one voice.",
