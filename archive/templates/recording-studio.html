                        I am in the process of expanding my studio. Right now, I can record up to four instruments at a time. I have already had a few small recording gigs in there for voiceovers and solo music recordings. This can be a great way to capture the sound youâ€™ve
                        always wanted out of your music!
                        <br><br> My rates are flexible depending on the project, but I generally charge $15.00 per microphone - per hour of recording, with a flat $10.00 for set up time. For mixing your recording, the rate is $5.00 per minute (rounding
                        up) per track.

                        I have recorded in several other venues, most notably on the Morrison Center Main Hall and at the Mountain View High School auditorium! I can adapt to many different setups to capture the sound you want the best!

                        I have a vast assortment of tools that can help you with your gig. Currently, I am running sound for <a href="https://armadacorps.org" target="_blank" class="link">Armada Winds</a>, which requires a large PA system, audio effects,
                        synchronization, and live-mixing!
                        <br>
                        <br> I can run sound for bands, gatherings, and more! If you are interested, my rates are flexible to your budget, just <a href="/about/contact" data-link="nav" class="link">contact me</a>!

                        Ever write a piece but don't have performers to record it? I can help! I have upwards of two terabytes of sounds I can use to replicate the ensemble you want! Here are two of my previous projects:
